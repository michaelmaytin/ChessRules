<h1>RULES  OF  CHESS</h1>

<p>

    Source Material
    Terms: 
    Only one Play Piece may be moved on a turn, except when castling (see description on back).<br>
    All Play Pieces must move in a straight path, except for the Knight.<br>
    The Knight is the only Play Piece that is allowed to jump over another Play Piece.<br>
    Play Piece Moves: A Pawn moves forward one square at a time.<br>
    There are two exceptions to this rule:<br>
    1. On a Pawn’s first move, it can move forward one or two squares.<br>
    2. When capturing a piece (see description on back), a Pawn moves one square diagonally ahead.<br>
    Knights move three squares at a time: two spaces forward or backward, then one space left or right, or two spaces to the left or right, then one space     forward or backward.<br>
    The move looks like the letter L.<br>
    The Bishop moves diagonally as many open squares as you like.<br>
    The Rook moves in a straight line, horizontally or vertically as many open squares as you like.<br>
    Besides the Queen, the Rook is the next most powerful Play Piece.<br>
    The Queen is the most powerful of the Play Pieces.<br>
    The Queen moves in any direction (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) as many open squares as you like.<br>
    The King is the most important Play Piece, because if it becomes trapped, you’ll lose the game.<br>
    The King moves one square in any direction, as long as it doesn’t put itself in Check.<br>
    Check: You are in Check if an opponent’s Play Piece is in a position on the board to capture your King.<br>
    To save your King from Check you must do one of the following:<br>
    1. Move the King out of the way of the opponent’s Play Piece.<br>
    2. Move another one of your Play Pieces to block your opponent.<br>
    3. Capture the opponent’s Play Piece that is threatening your King.<br>
    Checkmate: When your King cannot be saved from Check, it’s called Checkmate and you lost the game.<br>
    Checkmate means “the King is dead” in Persian.<br>
    Capturing: When you move one of your Play Pieces and it ends on an opponent’s Play Piece, you capture it and remove it from the Game Board.<br>
    The opponent’s Pawn, on its next turn only, can be moved diagonally to the space behind the first Pawn, capturing it.<br>

    Winning:<br>
    If you put your opponent’s King in Check so he can’t escape, call Checkmate… you win!<br>
